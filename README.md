# StreamDeck Streamer.Bot

This Elgato StreamDeck plugin allows for the runing of actions in Streamer.bot

The features are:
- An action button that can be linked to an action within Streamer.bot

NOTE: This plugin requires [Streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot) to work.

This is more of a proof of concept then a fully realized plugin, while it does work, it was thrown together very quickly, and I'm sure there are better ways to do what it does, and also to add more features/capabilities
